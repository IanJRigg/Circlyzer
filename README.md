# Circuit Analysis Lib
I'm going to be honest, I got really tired of analyzing circuits by hand. If I feel like it, I may implement this into a QT application for circuit analysis.

Development Path:
1. Network Creation
2. Network Simplification (Resistors in DC)
3. Loop Detection
4. KVL Analysis
5. KCL Analysis
6. Node/Mesh Analysis
7. Thevenin/Norton Equivalence
8. Introduction of Capacitors and Inductors
