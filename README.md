# **Circ**uit Ana**lyzer** 
I'm going to be honest, I got really tired of analyzing circuits by hand. If I feel like it, I may implement this into a QT application for circuit analysis.

Development Path: 
1. Test suite evaluation (Conversion to Google Test)
2. Network Creation
   - [x] Proof of concept (Nodes and Elements)
   - [ ] Evaluate memory safety of the network 
3. Network Simplification (Resistors in DC)
4. Loop Detection
5. KVL Analysis
6. KCL Analysis
7. Node/Mesh Analysis
8. Thevenin/Norton Equivalence
9. Introduction of Capacitors and Inductors
